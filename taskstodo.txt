Todo Next:
- COULD SHOW PIE CLICKAGE BY EXPANDING THE STROCK WIDTH + CHANGING ITS COLOUR. 
- Add red ring to pie viewer pie to show deletion?
- Turn deleteLinkPrompt() and deleteLinkPrompt() into sync/async code rather than with timeouts. 

- IMPORTANT: Fraction/decimal toggling
- Add red ring to pie viewer pie to show deletion?
- Tutorial

- Allow fractions in input
    Including whether they're top-heavy etc.
- Colouring of CPTs


Minor:
- Have new links added displayed as SelectedLink
- Keep drop-down button blue when selecting from it
- Explore colliison detection - possibly GitHub solution is bookmarked
- Colour all links coming from a node in black when that node is dragged?
ALLOW SECTOR ADDING FOR CONDITIONAL TABLES TOO
        IF A VALUE Is added, set its probability as 0 in the other prob distributions and put out a message to the user
        stating that this value has been added to all and can be included by using the drop-down menu. 
CONSIDER SECTOR RENAMING TOO
        MAYBE DISPLAY A MESSAGE 'DO you want to change this for all CPT pies?'
- For link deletion causing a reduction in the number of casual dependencies, if for one of the being
deleted variable values the distrubutions are all the same, then set this distribution instead of a uniform one. 
- Standford duel-coding of drop downs - when "Examples" is clicked render a page explanining the examples? 

Implement an "update pie" err whereby IF RENAME IS STILL OCCURING, ASK TO FINISH RENAME 1ST. 

- When displaying conditional pie table -> blank pie. Maybe add name "Conditional" onto it?

Other Todo:
- Extend everything to 3 conditionals - only works for 2 atm.
- 'Selected Node Indicator?'
- When added dependent link, conditional table shouldn't be white.
    Have indicator perhaps that table is newly enlarged? 
- Have a way to indicate what is being deleted before you do, so a halo on the nodes and corresponding circles. 
        HIGHLIGHT LINKS UPON DELETE - and possibly pie too?
- "Cannot remove a value from a node in a Bayesian graph!" add info on why. 


- JS vanilla prompt box doesn't support CSS
    To make error messages displayed in red.
    Could use a custom prompt box:
        https://www.cssscript.com/alert-confirm-prompt-popup-attention/
    May compromise browser compatability. 

- Arrow between pie and graph, rather than a button as is done at the minute. 
        Not sure how to HTML this layout atm. 

Done (POST User Trial):
- Be able to change node name. 
- Delete all labels when a new example graph is opened. 
- When displaying sum, have it as decimal if pie is fully decimal. 
- Add names to pies so it's easier to identify them 
- Added node comes in with force on it. Can you fix this initally?
        Due to d3.fixed(), this has been resolved indirectly
- Added color shading to arrow
- Added link selection indicator (black on hover)
- Added indicator of actual probability sum rather than just yes/no for sum to 1. 
- Decimal vs Fraction switcher
- Removing force moving nodes around after inital load-in. 
- Changed sector labels to inside (previous version, outside, was quite complicated - see labelCode.txt)
            WRITE ABOUT IN DISS
- If only 2 sectors, when the value of 1 is updated the other is updated to (1 - v) to
keep with sum = 1 (power of defaults!)
- Added delete confirmations for node & link deletions

Done:
- If pie value is 0, don't draw its label.
    Such as with Monty Hall Problem
- MACs don't have delete keys! Sort out. 
    Deleting is now done via shift + backspace, as backspace is used for text.
- Colour table text to be the same as sector colour?
    May cause accessability problems in terms of reading. 
    Instead added coloured squares
- Prevent links from being added twice.
- A node's conditonal table is affected when either:
        A node it's conditoned on changes (sectors added/deleted/modified)
        A node it's conditoned on is deleted.
        A link where it's the target is added/removed. 
    All of these are now considered - see updateConditionalTable for most of it.

Initally upon input a pie was auomatically made with uniform probabilities. 
    - Implemented a text input for probability values for non-conditional pies. 
    - Hit enterif you'd like a uniform pie. 
    - Should speed up entrance of values into the system. 

- ADDING/DELETING nodes to pie. 
    THINK I've dealt with all the edge cases, but would be good to check!
- Have conditionals a color that isn't blue, as it looks the same as an observed.
    - Gone with green (id 10 on color scale) as that won't likely be used (would require 10 sectors on a pie)
- Modified from having an "Update Graph" button to updates on graph happening #
  at the same time as pie updates, provided sum to 1. 
- Update drop down sector list for add/delete. 
- Do GREEN  TABLE ENTRY based on whether that value has a table or not. 
- Deleting link so a node is no longer conditional currently doesn't update until clicked.
- Include a way to click on sectors that are super small, such as a list of the
  value names that can be clicked on. 
    Done via a drop-down menu
- If a pie node only has 1 value, shouldn't need to select/deselect that one value (i.e. selectedSector by default)
- Add vertification to check pie chart values sum to 1 (for probabilties)
- Make LHS svg larger
- Ensure sector can't be deleted if only one sector. 
- Sort out colours in LHS pie.
- Sorting out text/pie size on LHS.
- Deleting of nodes/links. 
- Add vertification to ensure sector names within each pie are unique.
- Move edge arrow to better align with pie size. 
- When no nodes are left, black name banner still shows the last deleted node. Fix somehow?
- Uncaught exception when "update graph" pressed when node isn't there atm.
    - Fix by default pie when all have been deleted. 
- Sort out default pie when all nodes are removed from graph.
- Allow update of current pie sector on LHS. 
    (NOT name attr, as user should instead delete that variable outcome and make another)
- Text consitency between LHS and RHS
- LHS compatible with fractions. 
- Fix gap between LHS and RHS of / in fraction on LHS.
- 'Sector name cannot be modified' for conditonal - put name back in box when error message is there. 
- If less than 1, add a white segment to show how itâ€™s not complete. 
- Pie chart updated after conditionals modified due to node/link delete.
    Not necessary upon add as selectedNode changes to link origin. 
- When pie is deleted, default pie is displayed. 
- Re-formatted generateNode into functions to avoid a signficant amount of nested IF checks. 
        Originally both the input of the var's name and its value were in one function. 
- When both a fraction and decimal value are entered, the decimal is taken.
    Thus remove the fraction text upon submission, to make it clear it's now 
    a decimal value. 
- Have signal that pie chart's values are > 1.
- Adding link in a way such that node in graph updates to show it's dependent.

DISCUSS DEFAULT PIE IN DISS 
    Initally had as "Outcome" full pie, in defualt first colour. 
    Now it's more of an outline - use law from Interaction Design about shapes. 

Thought delay in update is due to the complex logic meaning it can't happen on that "tick". 
Was not - needed to call updateGraph at the end to lock in all changes.
