Todo Next:
- COULD SHOW PIE CLICKAGE BY EXPANDING THE STROCK WIDTH + CHANGING ITS COLOUR. 

- IMPORTANT: Fraction/decimal toggling

- Ask for file name for PNG export

- Format JSON output 

- Probability sum not updated when last sector is removed.
- Possibly include a "Do you want to delete this variable?" when all pie chart sectors are removed
from the viewer. 
- If sectors are deleted until there's only one, set it to 100%?

- Split website.css into sections for each folder in direc. 

- Show probability toggle for pie chart viewer? Could be a really helpful addition

- If user tries to add a pie sector that's already there, just update that pie sector
with the value included?

- Add logos to the drop-down examples menu     (Possibly using Bootstrap?)

- Add an "Adding link" indicator 

- Pull 'Admissons' into debug and test out deletions (think there may be a bug)

- Sort out conditonal renaming -> possibly remove the causal indicator (Tea: yes) when this is being done.

- Fix hovering over of 'examples'

- Turn deleteLinkPrompt() and deleteLinkPrompt() into sync/async code rather than with timeouts. 

- Cache marginal tables so if link is added then directly deleted the maginal table is used.

- Keep drop-down button blue when selecting from it

- Explore colliison detection - possibly GitHub solution is bookmarked

- Due to color vision deficiencies, itâ€™s a good idea to always complement error messages with an icon, 
e.g., a large exclamation mark on a red background 
        IMPLEMENT THEN INCLUDE IN DISS

- Colour all links coming from a node in black when that node is dragged?

ESSENTIAL (as written diss this way) - merge in validation for sector add and modify as one of them is missing some.

SORT OUT SECTOR ADDING FOR pie conditional on another pie.
        The sector added should just create a uniform pie. Right now it resets the entire distrubution to 
        be uniform. 

ALLOW SECTOR ADDING FOR CONDITIONAL TABLES TOO
        IF A VALUE Is added, set its probability as 0 in the other prob distributions and put out a message to the user
        stating that this value has been added to all and can be included by using the drop-down menu. 

CONSIDER SECTOR RENAMING TOO
        MAYBE DISPLAY A MESSAGE 'DO you want to change this for all CPT pies?'


RUN an algo to determine if a fraction is recurring:
https://www.google.com/search?q=check+if+a+fraction+is+recurring&rlz=1C1VDKB_en-GBGB1004GB1005&oq=check+if+a+fraction+is+recurring&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30j0i390i650l4.7515j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
If it is flag a warning to the user about using a decimal input insead (for sector probabilities)


VALUE INPUTS
- Add a length limit for variable name inputted.
    Possibly also deny the use of inappropriate words? 
- Add length limits for variable values inputted
- Allow fractions to be input in liklihood section

- Prompts don't allow red text, could be confusing between a correct and incorrect message.
        Add "Accepted!" and "An error has occured." to the top of each prompt sequence. 
        OR look into a custom format, but then there's issues with security for prompts etc. 

- Have new links added displayed as SelectedLink

- Add "New Link" message to green link being drawn?

- Add defualt colouring to CPTs to make them stand out better from the white background
- Add backgrounds to the pie section? 


- Enable the modification of conditional variable pie charts.

        IF A VALUE Is added, set its probability as 0 in the other prob distributions and put out a message to the user
        stating that this value has been added to all and can be included by using the drop-down menu. 

ALSO ENABLE NAME CHANGES TOO in CPT PIE SHOWING MODEEE

- "Please enter a name" for variable rename blank error -> possibly change to "Variables must be named"
and put the original name back in the text box. 


- For link deletion causing a reduction in the number of casual dependencies, if for one of the being
deleted variable values the distrubutions are all the same, then set this distribution instead of a uniform one. 

- For save-as-png include canvas-g tings. 

- Standford duel-coding of drop downs - when "Examples" is clicked render a page explanining the examples? 

SWAP TO BOOTSTRAP icon for better cross-platform support?
    https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

- In force presenter:
.attr("style", "font-family: arial; font-size: 14; fill: black; stroke: none; text-anchor: middle");
Put into CSS?

- Can only input variables as decimals atm - change so that you can input with fractions?

- Possibly make background a very light grey for better separation?

//Add one for pie in windowpresenter. 


- Change out JSON so that links is done on id (i.e. name) rather than position in array. 

        AS done in this example: https://medium.com/ninjaconcept/interactive-dynamic-force-directed-graphs-with-d3-da720c6d7811

Change sectorOptions so that drop-down items are deleted and drop-down hidden, rather than the drop-down being deleted.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3364493/how-do-i-clear-all-options-in-a-dropdown-box

HAVE IT SO THAT WHENEVER SOMETHING IS RE-DISPLAYED, IT'S TEXT/VALUE is also updated.
        so no older values are ever seen. 

//sum indicator not displaying for conditional pies - see generatePie - the bit on if(!conditionalTable){
    NEED to change display settings maybe

//Can you merge sectorModify() this stuff with sectorAdd()?

When pie err is thrown, the renaming stuff should be reset too - DON'T THINK THIS IS DONE YET. 
        I.E. HAVE IT SO THAT WHENEVER AN ERROR IS DISPLAYED, ALL "INPUTS" ARE RESET. 

Implement an "update pie" err whereby IF RENAME IS STILL OCCURING, ASK TO FINISH RENAME 1ST. 

- When displaying conditional pie table -> blank pie. Maybe add name "Conditional" onto it?

Other Todo:
- Extend everything to 3 conditionals - only works for 2 atm.
- update other side (decimal/fraction) - either remove or put as equivalent. 
        Not having a value on the other side makes it obvious whether it's been a decimal or fraction input tho. 
        Put up note if recurring decimal? 
- Convert pie's values using decimal/fraction buttons?
- Decimal/fraction slider could have a value for both.
        There's then the issues of recurring fractions.
            If they were represented as "0.3333" then pie likely wouldn't add to 1
            if student entered those values, and can't be assumed that they did mean
            1/3.
- Get "Conditional Table" message in right place using upper and lower screen DIVs
- 'Selected Node Indicator?'
- Default locations for graphs. 
- Stop nodes from going over the edge of the svg.
 
- Clear probability table when sectors of conditonal are added or deleted.
- Center text in table doesn't seem to work?
- When added dependent link, conditional table shouldn't be white.
    Have indicator perhaps that table is newly enlarged? 
- Have a way to indicate what is being deleted before you do, so a halo on the nodes and corresponding circles. 
        HIGHLIGHT LINKS UPON DELETE - and possibly pie too?
- "Cannot remove a value from a node in a Bayesian graph!" add info on why. 

Current Considerations:
- Have a look at text attributes more
    - Good websites:
        https://richardbrath.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/using-font-attributes-with-d3-js/
        https://www.integral-domain.org/lwilliams/tech/svg_d3/textGen.html
- Could get rid of update table button - enquire with Alan? 
- If there's only 1 value in pie, it being conditioned on is irrelevant. 
- JS vanilla prompt box doesn't support CSS
    To make error messages displayed in red.
    Could use a custom prompt box:
        https://www.cssscript.com/alert-confirm-prompt-popup-attention/
    May compromise browser compatability. 
-  Move the conditional table under the pie header label. 
        But currently BOTTOM may work best due to its size. 
- Arrow between pie and graph, rather than a button as is done at the minute. 
        Not sure how to HTML this layout atm. 
- Include way to highlight currently selected node on graph? Opacity of colour perhaps?
- Get rid of moving of pie when a sector is selected.
- Centre LHS pie in the svg. 
- Connect pieContainerText-style to CSS. 
- If > 1, add overlap between segments - blend colour. 
      Doesn't seem possible in D3.JS directly, and blending colour may confuse user. 
- Display stats values when pie is hovered over.  
- Uploading JSON files?
- Add manual positioning for JSON example graphs. 
        Include force as off. 

UPDATE BUTTON CHANGE
Got rid of 'update graph' button
        User has to make 2 changes to make node valid again, so hard to do by mistake. 
            As removing/adding/modifying a sector will take the sum out of 1.
            It would have started at 1 due to it being a valid pie. 
There was issues with its placement (including confusion with 'update table' vs 'update graph')
    Mention pie -> graph arrow idea. 

Done (POST User Trial):
- Be able to change node name. 
- Delete all labels when a new example graph is opened. 
- When displaying sum, have it as decimal if pie is fully decimal. 
- Add names to pies so it's easier to identify them 
- Added node comes in with force on it. Can you fix this initally?
        Due to d3.fixed(), this has been resolved indirectly
- Added color shading to arrow
- Added link selection indicator (black on hover)
- Added indicator of actual probability sum rather than just yes/no for sum to 1. 
- Decimal vs Fraction switcher
- Removing force moving nodes around after inital load-in. 
- Changed sector labels to inside (previous version, outside, was quite complicated - see labelCode.txt)
            WRITE ABOUT IN DISS
- If only 2 sectors, when the value of 1 is updated the other is updated to (1 - v) to
keep with sum = 1 (power of defaults!)
- Added delete confirmations for node & link deletions

Done:
- If pie value is 0, don't draw its label.
    Such as with Monty Hall Problem
- MACs don't have delete keys! Sort out. 
    Deleting is now done via shift + backspace, as backspace is used for text.
- Colour table text to be the same as sector colour?
    May cause accessability problems in terms of reading. 
    Instead added coloured squares
- Prevent links from being added twice.
- A node's conditonal table is affected when either:
        A node it's conditoned on changes (sectors added/deleted/modified)
        A node it's conditoned on is deleted.
        A link where it's the target is added/removed. 
    All of these are now considered - see updateConditionalTable for most of it.

Initally upon input a pie was auomatically made with uniform probabilities. 
    - Implemented a text input for probability values for non-conditional pies. 
    - Hit enterif you'd like a uniform pie. 
    - Should speed up entrance of values into the system. 

- ADDING/DELETING nodes to pie. 
    THINK I've dealt with all the edge cases, but would be good to check!
- Have conditionals a color that isn't blue, as it looks the same as an observed.
    - Gone with green (id 10 on color scale) as that won't likely be used (would require 10 sectors on a pie)
- Modified from having an "Update Graph" button to updates on graph happening #
  at the same time as pie updates, provided sum to 1. 
- Update drop down sector list for add/delete. 
- Do GREEN  TABLE ENTRY based on whether that value has a table or not. 
- Deleting link so a node is no longer conditional currently doesn't update until clicked.
- Include a way to click on sectors that are super small, such as a list of the
  value names that can be clicked on. 
    Done via a drop-down menu
- If a pie node only has 1 value, shouldn't need to select/deselect that one value (i.e. selectedSector by default)
- Add vertification to check pie chart values sum to 1 (for probabilties)
- Make LHS svg larger
- Ensure sector can't be deleted if only one sector. 
- Sort out colours in LHS pie.
- Sorting out text/pie size on LHS.
- Deleting of nodes/links. 
- Add vertification to ensure sector names within each pie are unique.
- Move edge arrow to better align with pie size. 
- When no nodes are left, black name banner still shows the last deleted node. Fix somehow?
- Uncaught exception when "update graph" pressed when node isn't there atm.
    - Fix by default pie when all have been deleted. 
- Sort out default pie when all nodes are removed from graph.
- Allow update of current pie sector on LHS. 
    (NOT name attr, as user should instead delete that variable outcome and make another)
- Text consitency between LHS and RHS
- LHS compatible with fractions. 
- Fix gap between LHS and RHS of / in fraction on LHS.
- 'Sector name cannot be modified' for conditonal - put name back in box when error message is there. 
- If less than 1, add a white segment to show how itâ€™s not complete. 
- Pie chart updated after conditionals modified due to node/link delete.
    Not necessary upon add as selectedNode changes to link origin. 
- When pie is deleted, default pie is displayed. 
- Re-formatted generateNode into functions to avoid a signficant amount of nested IF checks. 
        Originally both the input of the var's name and its value were in one function. 
- When both a fraction and decimal value are entered, the decimal is taken.
    Thus remove the fraction text upon submission, to make it clear it's now 
    a decimal value. 
- Have signal that pie chart's values are > 1.
- Adding link in a way such that node in graph updates to show it's dependent.

DISCUSS DEFAULT PIE IN DISS 
    Initally had as "Outcome" full pie, in defualt first colour. 
    Now it's more of an outline - use law from Interaction Design about shapes. 

Thought delay in update is due to the complex logic meaning it can't happen on that "tick". 
Was not - needed to call updateGraph at the end to lock in all changes.
